# Restoresa
A university project by KTU students for the Program systems engineering module

Demo: [restoresa.lt](https://www.restoresa.lt)

# Our project 
Restaurant reservation web application which also features food ordering at the same time.
# Technical task
The objective is to develop a sophisticated website that offers customers the convenience of reserving a table at a dining establishment and selecting from a diverse range of menu items. This ambitious endeavor utilizes popular technologies such as "React," "Firebase," "Docker," "Stripe," and "NodeJS."

The utilization of React facilitates the creation of an elegant and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless and engaging booking experience. The comprehensive backend infrastructure, powered by Firebase, handles critical aspects such as secure data storage, robust user authentication, and real-time updates, providing a secure and scalable system.

The integration of Docker simplifies the deployment and management of the application, enabling portability across different environments. The incorporation of Stripe, a trusted payment processing platform, ensures secure online transactions, allowing customers to make reservations and additional orders with confidence.

NodeJS handles the server-side logic, facilitating seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.

In summary, this website combines the power of React, Firebase, Docker, Stripe, and NodeJS to deliver a user-friendly platform. Customers can easily reserve tables, explore the menu, and make secure online payments, while the backend systems ensure efficient management and scalability.
# Architecture
Our project consist of Server side as well as client side defined functions in order to make requests as secure as possible in each way.

Node.JS is being stored inside a Docker image container for easier hosting across different platforms. Primarly, our project uses Node.JS in order to initiate payment intents. From that point it calls Stripe API endpoint with its own predefined function to create an intent and send back into Node.JS server. Lastly, Node.JS server returns client's requested payment intent for payment completion.

Stripe API is being used on Client-side too for confirming payments as well as checking the current intent' progress.

Firebase is easy to implemenent. It creates an opportunity of implementing authentication feature in a matter of minutes. Changing password, number or getting free tables for the selected hour and date is done with the help of Firebase Functions. Those functions are Node.JS based environment, which stays active only on endpoint calls - that why it sometimes called serverless.

# Testing
#### The method of our choice for testing out the system was manual testing. We prepared an excel spreadsheet, that was filled withtests that were to be executed. And then our team members tested out the functionality and filled out the results.

# Installing and Running the Project

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v19.7.0

    $ npm --version
    9.6.5

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

###
### Yarn installation
  After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.

      $ npm install -g yarn

---

## Install
    $ git clone https://github.com/Mantofka/restoresa.git
    $ cd restoresa
    $ npm install /(or)/ yarn install

    You will also need to clone restoresa-backend if you do not have the ability to host your own backend heroku-api
    $ git clone https://github.com/Mantofka/restoresa-backend.git
    $ cd restoresa-backend
    $ npm install /(or)/ yarn install

## Running the project
    Run dev
    $ npm start /(or)/ yarn start

    Run backend
    $ node server.js

## Simple build for production

    $ npm build /(or)/ yarn build

## Docker image build for fast and light usage
    $ docker build -t restoresa .
    $ docker run -p 443:443 -p 80:80  restoresa:latest
# Using the project
### Starting off
upon running the project you can choose to
1. use the local site:                        http://localhost:3000/
2. use our implemented and hosted website:    https://restoresa.lt/
### The homepage
  After opening up an instance of the site you are greeted by our homepage
